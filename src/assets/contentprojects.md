## **ColorKineType**

*p5.js, matter.js, openCV, typography, animated, interactiv, webapp, MIT*
is a web application. Programmed as part of my Master's course, it allows text data to be processed in batches of textured and animated points, to which physical behaviours of attraction, elasticity, friction, etc. are assigned.

## **Bonjour**

*web2print, exhibition, animated*
was the title of the exhibition our master degree graduation projects for our school (ESAD Valence Grenoble). I used ColorKineType to produce differents "BONJOUR" for the communication printed medias and some animations for instagram.

## **Sketch-2-Print**

*p5.js, pagedjs, web2print, interactiv, webapp*
is a web application. It lets you view and manipulate a wide variety of graphic content (video stream, 3D model, connectivity to peripherals, etc.) in a layout document that can be exported directly for printing.

## **Flowers From Mars**

*p5.js, gamepad, illustrations, riso*
is a concept I'm developing around the imagery of unknown biological life forms on Earth. These 3 "flowers" are made from a pattern I drew and manipulated with an Xbox controller on a web canvas, also a web application I'm developing.

## **Projet Éclaté**

*p5.js, 3D, blender, animated, sound synch, video*
is an experimental project. Extracted from experiments with p5.js and a 17-piece 3D model of a criterium, 6 of these pieces are manipulated to create what might be described as a vessel, a kind of air or space transport vehicle. And with the touch of a button, regenerate a whole new shape, a whole new unique design.

## **Grid Sketches**

*p5.js, rastering, animated, generated*
are images and videos outputed from exploring a gridded interface to discretize images or play around with the cells and some interactivity.

3D render of two objects from my 3rd year Diploma

Animation of stick man running, I composed 6 scenes with different color palettes and animation parameters to produce this simple 20sc video available as NFT on fxhash.

Interactive animation inspiried from Victor Vasarely's work.
